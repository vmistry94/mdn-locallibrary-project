# Local Library from MDN

This is a demo project, based on MDN's tutorial series [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django), with some alterations made my me.

The project is hosted on Heroku here, with minimal GA4 tracking set-up: https://mdn-locallibrary-sandbox.herokuapp.com/.
